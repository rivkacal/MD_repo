short day: communication outage + writing research proposal. Also:

coarse-grain:
*run control experiment for hist_per_test.py experiments (hist_0p5charge_control.py) for trying to assess the effect of fraction of charged histidine and its ordering. The control of hist0p5 files includes the parameters for HIS1 type with a charge of 0.5 to compare the charge effect.
  
  -results are in: /trajectories/rivka/his_per_tests_results/his0p5/
  -analysis ran using: ./run_his0p5_analysis.sh after ran ,oved to analysis_scripts
  -final results: hists_per_tests_fragB_hisEE_his05control.ipynb notebook and check all hists_per_tests_fragB_translated_histdistsEEgrouped/&grouped_control/&even/&even_control 4 files. figures are saved with horizontal line containing the previous only his0.5 results as control. see for instance: uniform_control.png


*trying to apply the H++ for known histidine charges of my previous amberff simulations for fragment B. Results for simulation 10ns frame after 500ns previous run with all histidines non-charged for internal dielectric constant of 4 and 10 are in pdbs_images/0.125_80_4_pH7_fragB_noH.result.pdb and 0.125_80_10_pH7_fragB_noH.result.pdb showing as expected 0 charged histidines predicted see fragB_all_his0_hpp.png. However for simulations of all 16 HIS charged: 0.125_80_10_pH7_segB_hispplus1_500ns_then_10ns_nH.result.pdb  only two predicted as charged histidines : fragB_all_his1_hpp.png. The importance of initial frame for determining HIS form is crucial and challenging for IDRs

all-atom:
*create /home_d/rivka/Bioinformatics_HIS/all_atom/HSP_PHE  &&  /home_d/rivka/Bioinformatics_HIS/all_atom/PHE_PHE  && /home_d/rivka/Bioinformatics_HIS/all_atom/HSD_HSD  
  please note the charm ff directory of HSP includes an extended ffbonded file with NH2 CTA CT2A angles and dihedrals with H, CPH1, HA2 which are missing and copied form newer ff versions.

*prepare initial frame to run from and pulling conformations to submit on cluster like: /home/rivka/Bioinformatics/all-atom/minimize_geometry/HSP_PHE

12/10/2022
short day as before:

all-atom simulations were not running during the night but during this day.
*mistake in submit file scratch directory -> script ran but was not outputting! resubmtting everything
#simulations running super-slow - rethink using 32 cores ind=stead 16 


prepare a script to gather all the free-energy values and com to plot:
*initial stepes: /home_d/rivka/Bioinformatics_HIS/all_atom/HSD_PHE/umbrella/free_energy_grep.sh (will later be moved to a scripts useful directory like: /home_d/rivka/Bioinformatics_HIS/all_atom/useful_files
reading the output of uniformlly spaced initial com conformations of the two pi groups from a given /trajectories/rivka directory into a free_energy.dat output file including the conformation id (e.g. id 17 for :  umbrella17.edr conf17.gro) the initial com hraminically restraned distance and the free energy average value.
*finished writing script: see result vi /home_d/rivka/Bioinformatics_HIS/all_atom/HSD_PHE/umbrella/free_energy_vs_com.dat 
*find script also at: vi /home_d/rivka/Bioinformatics_HIS/all_atom/useful_files//free_energy_grep.sh

*create a script for searching T-faced histidines in all files, not just 'charged' directory with all aromatic residues! see: vi /home_d/rivka/Bioinformatics_HIS/python_codes/test_analysis/find_his_prependicular.py
* restricting more with the script:  python find_his_prependicular_quantumstruc.py

14/10/2022
*research proposal, try to justify that all existing quantum info does not yield observed conformations. Need to MD is there,..

*results from looking for prependicular T-shaped like conformation are there running over 6535 pdb files. vi T_shaped_all.csv: 468 such interactions but repeating chains, distance of 4A like quantum!

*find only his-his prependicular: python find_his_his_prepend.py
*from T_shaped_his_his4A.csv: 276 such conformations

16/10/2022

resubmitting cluster runs. Turns out using 64 cores 4,8 options improves run by 100 times faster!!!!!!!!!!!!!! compared to using 32 only (running two simultaneously)

resubmitting: HSD_HSD , PHE_PHE and HSP_PHE all using charm36!! (note dates) . 1.2 hour per run, total 41 runs -> 13 hours using 4 nodes if available :)

*preparing new HSD_PHE simulations in water!! /home_d/rivka/Bioinformatics_HIS/all_atom/HSD_PHE/umbrella/water
to compare with quantum results http://journal.chemistrycentral.com/content/7/1/92

17/10/2022
some all atom simulations returned!
adding PHE-PHE and HSD-HSD and HSP-PHE to profiles graph in umbrella_plots.ipynb located at : /home_d/rivka/Bioinformatics_HIS/all_atom/HSD_PHE/umbrella/txts (until it'll shift)

18/10/2022
conference : 8:30 - 17:30 
results from HSD_PHE_charm36_water yielded a potential that's not satisfying...

23/10/2022
working on the presentation for Tuesday. Research proposal discussion with Koby: avoid using 'jargons' as LLPS or names of specific coarse-grain models as HPS and KH.
make a flow that's organized. Number goals and refer to it by ordering. 

24/10/2022
preparing presenations. Reading about pi-pi stacking in force fields and types of force-fields to be used...


25/10/2022
presenting my presentation!! so far nite to include titles for graphs and or descritions to follow!
milan suggested using MD force fields or QM methods to use r,teta and phi coordinates to get minimal energy geometry! but then many simulations to run. Also 50 ns may be enough...

26/10/2022
login to chemfarm!!!!
ssh -X rivkac@chemfarm.weizmann.ac.il

analyze his sequence fraction in IDPS > 0.02 or 2% . using milan's code to download from Uniprot server and a predictor of IDPs probability (to extract > 0.5%)

29/10/2022
version 2 of research proposal.
got stuck with some issues of avogadro2 trying to import python code for input to orca. Still orca script is not running properly due to misuse of cores...

30/10/2022
submitted research proposal!!!
continue working on histidine statistics with ordered or disordered...
install plotly trying to create an interactive scrollbar for choosing the best number of bins...
see: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-quickly-find-the-best-bin-width-for-your-histogram-4d8532f053b0

not working...

Checking for consequtive histidine sequqnces. Check: /stats/HIS_IDPS/dis_his_indices. found sequqnces with the following idx as well:

[19, 28, 103, 107, 108, 110, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 133, 143]

find a nice algorithm to quantify these sequqnces...

31/10/2022
trying to test different HIS sequences: disordered_analysis.ipynb:
use groupby to cluster histidines indices and length as in file: his_array_sizw. The counter (line) of sequence is also appended to his_array_lines_idx where the lines correspond to the id from the IDPS equal or longer than 40 list: proteins_id_larger40
Now dividing this clusters into groups of 2,3,4,5 etc...:
finally creating len_arr which contains the size of largest cluster for each sequence of histidines (from 0 to 14)!!
same analysis for all residues: '../HIS_IDPS/dis_{filename}_indices' where filename fits CYS,ALA,PHE,ARG....
no apparent correlation found. Try to compare to LYS and ARG as positive: ../HIS_IDPS/dis_positive_frac
see: '../HIS_IDPS/dis_positive_indices
missing counts!!i

---election and vacation!! --

succeded installing avogadro with orca input on my windows laptop!!
now working on tutorials how to use and study dimers structures...

login from cmd on windows to chemfarm: ssh rivkac@chemfarm.weizmann.ac.il
copy file from windows to chemfarm using cmd:

8/11/2022
courses!! 
fixing 3 day problem: why txt file was returning qsub directive error! the orca input file was prepared in windows platform bu avogadro extension to create orca input!
This windows files specific strings may have different lengths other than unix/linux platform of chemfarm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To convert windows made txt to unix use: 
dos2unix filename
#than wait till convertion is done succesfully. Now optimization script was running on chemfarm successfully using: 
pbsorca trial2.xyz.inp long
#! still problem left to solve: cannot read more than 16 cpus... (32 returns error within file). Maybe 40 will work, etc.. 
Testing how long it'll take to optimize structure using trial2.xyz.inp parameters.
Left to understand the functional choise and other by using orca 5.0.3 documentations PDF.
Also finished simple analysis of histidine in ordered vs disordered (cutting proteins to IDRS based on prediction over 50% to be IDR) data:
see: disordered_structures.ipynb at /home_d/rivka/Bioinformatics_HIS/stats/HIS_IDPS
or ordered_structures.ipynb at /home_d/rivka/Bioinformatics_HIS/stats/HIS_ordered

9/11/2022
updating statistics of ordered vs IDRs for proteins < 500 aa
adding a correlation line?
see: structured_less_than500aa.html  or disordered_less_500aa.html within the above diiscovered directories

Also chemfarm trial2.xyz.inp results just finished running after 1 hour and 50 min!!!
learn what to do with the results...

copy a file from chemfarm to windows:
scp rivkac@chemfarm.weizmann.ac.il:\work\rivkac\projects\histidine_qm\trial2.xyz.xyz "OneDrive - weizmann.ac.il\myThesisStudies\QM" 

apparently cannot use unix2dos on cmd (windows) so do that on chemfarm...
unix2dos trial_dos.xyz 
unix2dos: converting file trial_dos.xyz to DOS format ...
scp rivkac@chemfarm.weizmann.ac.il:\work\rivkac\projects\histidine_qm\trial_dos.xyz "OneDrive - weizmann.ac.il\myThesisStudies\QM"
after optimization calculation was done (16 cores - 24 minutes) for 2imidazoles. Take each of them seperately, imidazoleA and B to calculate single-point-energy to find the binding energy!

10/11/2022
apparently partially stacked opt failed -> increase maxiter to 500 as in 2imid_stacked.inp
also trying to test 2-3/D dimensional PES scan to find other minimas
first trying from orca_manual_5_0_3: for COH2 find 3D_scan.inp.
note that .opt file saves evry conformation so it'll later can be tested, or the last one can be continued from... 

stats analysis: found for structured data a protein with 26% his: 1hcd.pdb file.

1. a) for structured proteins with less than 100 a.a the highest percentage of HIS is ~18. If we consider 118a.a then,I found one with 26% HIS (not sure if this is the one that you once sent me paper about). This protein serves as a pH sensor for changes of H+. Histidines are fully exposed to the outside of the protein surroundings:

graphs of dependence of number of positive/negative/aromatic aa clusters (at least 3 consequtive) called stretches is to be organized yet. 

also 3D_scan of 4 atoms took almost 4 hours for very few points...
left to understand how to analyze it and how its working!!!!


13/11/10 
Meeting with Dubai-AI.
trying to follow finding minimas conformation very similar to 
DOI
    https://doi.org/10.1039/C5OB01108F . Using MacroModel of Scrodinger takes 48 hours to get approval to use.
Meanwhile exploring other methods like crest-xtb based (quantum level not ff) presented also in ACONFL paper for finding conformers: 
https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.2c02439
which I was reading during Gershom-Martin group...

installing here both xtb platform and then crest from grimme's github tutotrial works in test directory (only from downloads) by using:
crest 2imidazoles_control.xyz | tee -a crest_output.txt & nohup

where 2imidazoles_contro.xyz is a regular xyz file of the dseired molecules.
tee -a outputfilename directs content from terminal to a text file too. & nohup should prevent the program from stopping when closing the terminal,
however it's not running in background somehow...

copy best conformation output:
scp best_dos.xyz rivkac@chemfarm.weizmann.ac.il:/work/rivkac/projects/histidine_qm

to perform:
unix2dos best_dos.xyz
and then from cmd on windows:
scp rivkac@chemfarm.weizmann.ac.il:\work\rivkac\projects\histidine_qm\best_dos.xyz "OneDrive - weizmann.ac.il\myThesisStudies\QM"

similarly for all conformations ensemble scp crest_conformers.xyz  rivkac@chemfarm.weizmann.ac.il:/work/rivkac/projects/histidine_qm
then from chemfarm: unix2dos crest_conformers.xyz

after installing my own xtb on chemfarm and crest there, sourcing ~/.bashrc and creating submission script it finally works!!
be carefull: 
qsub submit_crest.sh

now reading useful flags to run with!! see: https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/crestcmd.html
